- 👋 Hi, I’m @nirvism
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, VR, AR, fine arts, poetry, music, literature, Trancendental meditation, web3, humans.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AR with Artivive, how to animate my paintings and collages with Plotaverse, re-learning Photoshop & Illustrator. Want to learn Adobe After Effects, Procreate, and now to deal with life in the most productive way so I stay sane.   
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on art projects, books, events that promote such things. Would love to start a VR club of some sort for learning and fun.  
- 📫 How to reach me dm me on Instagram @hello_nirvanalife
